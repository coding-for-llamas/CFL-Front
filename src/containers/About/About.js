                    I have been interested in the tech field since I was a child, taking apart and rebuilding electronic
                    toys that my father would bring home, fascinated with how they worked.

                    My true passion really took off back in the early days of Neopets, though. I wanted to be able to
                    customize my user lookup, so I started dabbling with simple HTML and CSS with the help of their
                    personal guides.

                    In later years, I expanded to myspace (customizing my user page) and began to build static sites.
                    Most of the sites I put together were simple in nature, but I found the process of it all
                    fascinating.

                    Since then, I&apos;ve gone to community college to obtain my Career Service Certificate in web
                    programming, and I have taken a vested interest in learning as much as I can. My main focus is on
                    accessibility in web development - it is my belief
                    that accessible web design can both look and run just as well as traditionaly programmed websites
                    when accessibility is considered from the beginning.

              <p>The internet should be accessible to all and with a little forethought, that is achievable!</p>
